Kanteron Systems was founded on August 23rd 2005. We are always looking forward, but, just for a moment, let's remember these amazing 15 years.

<!--more-->

Besides Kanteron Systems, 2005 was the birth year of YouTube, Unity Game Engine, Git, Google Maps, XBox360, uTorrent, Etsy, Automattic, Box, TeamViewer, YCombinator, Reddit, Selfies, CyberMonday...

That year Yahoo acquired Flicker, Google Android, Adobe Macromedia, News Corp. MySpace, Lenovo IBM's PC division...

Many things happened in 2005: Hurricane Katrina, IRA's end of armed conflict, Hong Kong's Disneyland opened, the H5N1 Avian Flu, the AirBus A380 first flight, Spain legalized gay marriages and homosexual couples' rights...

The top websites back then were AltaVista, Excite, GeoCities, HotWired, and Lycos. Remember any of them?

Back then we did not have hashtags, or iPhones.

We were playing Half-Life 2, God of War, Metal Gear Solid 3, Guitar Hero, Burnout Revenge, Psychonauts, Tekken 5, GTA San Andreas...

We were watching The Colbert Report, How I met your mother, Star Wars Episode III...

As the band of hopeless dreamers and idealists we've always been, we started collaborating with open source healthcare technology projects, developing our own, and learning the hard way that this market is rigged, that selling without connections, a large marketing budget, and a well known brand name, is hard.

But 15 years later, here we are. Against all odds (75% failure vs 25% survival, according to the SBA). And after all those experiments and experiences, we've learned a few lessons. So brace yourselves for another 15 years of break-neck innovation, and challenging the established norms of healthcare IT's oligopoly. Because we're here to turn things upside down, and fight mammoths and dinosaurs, so clinicians and patients can have faster diagnosis and more accurate treatments through better data integration.
