Shawn Larson, Senior Project Manager at HSCIC, announced the general availability of Kanteron source code for the NHS on Monday, June 6, at [UKRC](https://www.ukrc.org.uk/programme) (the largest diagnostic imaging event in the UK). The announcement was made during the session: _PACS 2.0 (the next generation) has now happened – any real difference?_

In conjunction with HSCIC’s OpenPACS and NHS England’s Code 4 Health / Open Source initiatives, Kanteron Systems has made the source code of its Translational Medical Information Server (TMIS) platform freely available to the NHS. To access the code repository, users are required to submit their details here: [www.kanteron.com/NHS](https://www.kanteron.com/NHS)

> Kanteron TMIS platform can be utilized by the NHS to store, integrate, analyze and visualize medical imaging (PACS-RIS), digital pathology, clinical genomics, pharmacogenomics and biosensor data.

Currently several trusts are in discussion with Kanteron Systems around new and innovative uses for TMIS: **from multi-institution multi-vendor PACS integration** initiatives, **to genomic data management in a genomic medicine center, to digital pathology workflows in a large trust**.

Kanteron Systems, in partnership with industry leaders like Microsoft Azure, IBM/Apple, Hitachi Data Systems and others, are also able to provide additional fee-based services around the TMIS platform e.g. technical support, certification, training, data migration, etc.
