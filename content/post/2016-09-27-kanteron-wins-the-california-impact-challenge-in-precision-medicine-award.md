Kanteron Systems has been recognized as the leader in Precision Medicine, and awarded the 2016 [**Precision Medicine Impact Challenge**](https://singularityu.org/ca-impact-challenge/)  Award by [The California Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR)](https://www.opr.ca.gov/) and the [Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz)](https://business.ca.gov/), in collaboration with [Singularity University (SU)](https://exponential.singularityu.org/medicine/).

The [**Precision Medicine Impact Challenge**](https://singularityu.org/ca-impact-challenge/) was announced by Atul Butte, MD, PhD, director of the UCSF Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Elizabeth Baca, MD, MPA, from the Governor‘s OPR at the Precision Public Health summit [hosted by UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/06/403221/white-house-gates-foundation-summit-explores-applying-precision-medicine-public) in June 2016, convened by [the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-key-actions-accelerate) and [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/).

This award entitles Kanteron to a $10,000 prize plus the opportunity to attend and present at the [Exponential Medicine conference in San Diego](https://exponential.singularityu.org/medicine/) on Oct 8-11, 2016.

> Singularity University [stated](https://twitter.com/singularityu/status/748215025416953856): "Our California Impact Challenge will bring the future of precision medicine to the present."

The National Institutes of Health describe precision medicine as an "emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle for each person."

California Governor Jerry Brown‘s administration has been an enthusiastic supporter of precision medicine. In April 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown announced the launch of the [California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine (CIAPM)](https://www.ciapm.org/). Hosted by [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/), this $3 million partnership between the state, the University of California, and other public and private entities aims to help build the infrastructure and assemble the resources necessary to advance precision medicine-oriented data, tools and applications. The governor‘s 2016-17 budget proposal would add another $10 million to fund additional demonstration projects within the precision medicine initiative.

> "Kanteron Systems is proud to have been recognized by such a prestigious award as a leader in precision medicine", said Jorge Cortell, Founder & CEO, Kanteron Systems.
