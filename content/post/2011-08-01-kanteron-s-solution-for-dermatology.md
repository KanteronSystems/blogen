Kanteron Systems introduces a new solution for Dermatology. Based on a special microscope mounted on an iPhone, and a <a title="KDS" href="https://www.kanteron.com/blog/products/kds/" target="_blank">KDS</a> workstation, it allows the Dermatologist to take close-up pictures of the skin, which are automatically and wirelessly sent to the workstation, where the images are turned into DICOM (and therefore can be measured, annotated, etc), and sent to the PACS.
