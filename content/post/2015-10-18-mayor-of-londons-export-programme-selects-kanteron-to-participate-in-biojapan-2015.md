The Mayor of London Boris Johnson MP travelled to Yokohama (Japan) with representatives from 8 of the most promising BioTech companies in London to promote UK-Japan collaboration in cell therapy and regenerative medicine at the BioJapan 2015. BioJapan is Asia’s leading biotechnology event, attracting thousands of representatives from some 700 of the world’s leading bioscience companies every year. This year it took place October 14th – 16th at Pacifico Yokohama. Kanteron Systems is amongst this select group, exhibiting at booth C-14, and represented by its CEO Jorge Cortell.

Kanteron Systems‘ award-winning, cutting-edge healthcare IT solution “TMIS” is the first truly complete personalized medicine solution in the market. It integrates genomics, pharmacogenomics, digital pathology, radiology, biosensors, and analytics into a single unified workflow to produce a complete visualization with deep integration, enabling researchers and clinicians to reach precise diagnostics with unparalleled ease and speed.

“_Integrating medical imaging, pathology, genomic and pharmacogenomic data into EMR systems to apply precision medicine to a large-scale patient base is something that has never been done before, and the benefits are really huge_” said Jorge Cortell, CEO, Kanteron Systems. "_We are proud to have been chosen to participate in this trade mission alongside the most promising BioTech companies in London, to bring this uniquely innovative and deeply integrated solution to clinicians in Japan and beyond_.”

The Mayor of London said: "_Kanteron is exactly the type of company we hoped to attract with the MedCity initiative. Their healthcare software will make a huge impact on the NHS and the world_."

Dr Eliot Forster, Executive Chair of MedCity, says: “_I’m absolutely delighted to be bringing some of our most exciting biotechs to Japan._"
