Organized by the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB/ELIXIR-ES) and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), ECCB2020 is the main computational biology and bioinformatics conference this year in Europe.

Led by Dr. Pablo Marin, along other members of his team like mathematician Jose M. Juanes Ph.D. (c), data scientist Pedro Pons, and bioinformaticians Rodiel Martinez and Anastasiya Onofriychuk, the 2 scientific posters presented at ECCB2020 are:

In Kanteron Systems we’re proud of the research and development work our Bioinformatics department is producing, in collaboration with other institutions, and in an open-science manner. This research is later converted, with the help of our Software Development department, into Precision Medicine solutions available to clinicians worldwide.

Great job, team!
