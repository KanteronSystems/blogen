Campbell, CA, March 16, 2016 – Dicom Systems, Inc., an Enterprise Imaging interoperability expert, announced today its partnership with Kanteron Systems, Inc. (USA, Spain, and UK).  This partnership will deliver more comprehensive, real-time patient information to specialists, enabling improved correlation of clinical data and medical imaging within one, consolidated visual context.

Kanteron Systems, the leading aggregator of Genomics, Pathology and Radiology imaging and data for multi-discipline clinical specialists, has selected Dicom Systems and its Enterprise Imaging Workflow Unifier as a universal adapter to seamlessly integrate its clinical data management solutions within any healthcare enterprise environment.

“This partnership is highly symbiotic,” says Florent Saint-Clair, Dicom Systems EVP. “Kanteron reduces data fragmentation at the clinical level, while Dicom Systems focuses on reducing IT-level fragmentation and communications.  The complexities inherent in combining Genomics, Oncology, Pathology and Radiology workflows present a unique integration and infrastructural challenge, in that so many fragmented silos of imaging data are necessary to present clinicians with a full picture of their patient’s current state.  Kanteron is the first platform we’ve seen that comprehensively solves all the pieces of this large puzzle into one, cohesive visualization layer, allowing clinicians and diagnosticians to more readily correlate large amounts of fragmented data. Dicom Systems is proud to complement Kanteron’s effort by ensuring a painless, highly customizable integration process.”

“The partnership with Dicom Systems is particularly well-aligned with our core business philosophy of being responsible to our clients by recognizing no vendor can be fully prepared to effectively address all technical issues in a highly complex enterprise environment,” said John Memarian, Kanteron President and Chief Commercial Officer. “We share common goals and values with Dicom Systems in customer service, and continually strive to improve our offerings to the market and raise the technology standards. Our partnership with Dicom Systems represents an ecosystem of like-minded organizations. We look forward to many successful campaigns both in the US and the global market.”
