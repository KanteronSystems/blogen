Kanteron Systems is proud to announce it has joined institutions like Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, American Society of Clinical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, IBM, or Google, in the <a title="https://genomicsandhealth.org/" href="https://genomicsandhealth.org/" target="_blank">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>.

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (Global Alliance) is an international coalition, formed by over 150 of the world’s leading organizations (including healthcare providers, research funders, research institutions, disease advocacy organizations, and life science and information technology companies) to enable the sharing of genomic and clinical data.

Genomic information offers great potential to inform the understanding of disease, but in order to learn it is often necessary to combine information across diseases, organizations, methods, and even countries. The members of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health are working together to create interoperable approaches that will enable the responsible, voluntary, and secure sharing of genomic and clinical data in order to advance understanding, prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease.
