On September 28th, Kanteron Systems and its distributor, [Reliable](https://reliable.com.mx/productos/patologia.html), installed the first digital pathology diagnostic system in Mexico.

The Siglo XXI National Medical Center is a hospital complex located in the Doctores colony of Mexico City, created in 1951, and administered by the Mexican Institute of Social Security [IMSS](https://www.imss.gob.mx/ directory/).

The Cardiology Hospital, Childrens Hospital, Oncology Hospital, and Specialties Hospital are all part of it, all with the rank of High Specialty Medical Unit (UMAE). It has 1000 beds, 24 medical and epidemiological research units, 30 teaching rooms and 7 auditoriums. It is responsible for 6 specialized departments in cardiology, pediatrics and oncology.

Providing service to all of them, their Pathology Department has decided to be the pioneer in the country with the digitalization of its complete workflow, which means more than 70,000 slides with pathology samples per year. For this they chose Kanteron Systems, who with their distributor in the country, Reliable, has installed the first diagnostic digital pathology system in Mexico.

Moving from a completely manual and analog system:

To a completely digital one:

The Kanteron Systems Platform is responsible for processing orders, printing the bar code directly on the slides, creating cases, assigning them to patients and doctors, managing and dicomizing the images produced by a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S210 scanner, producing the reports and making them available to the entire hospital network, including patients.

From Kanteron Systems we want to congratulate CMN Siglo XXI, Reliable, and Hamamatsu for an excellent team work.
