Kanteron Systems Brings Expertise in Medical Imaging and Clinical Genomics SaaS to Google Cloud Platform

September 18, 2017 - 12:00

VALENCIA—(SPAIN)--Kanteron Systems, a pioneer in Precision Medicine clinical data integration, today announced it has been named a Google Cloud Platform Technology Partner, to provide a Software as a Service solution that allows clinicians worldwide to offer Precision Medicine at the point of care.

The collaboration between Google Cloud Platform and Kanteron Systems enables Healthcare Delivery Organizations (HDOs) and patients to benefit from integration of medical imaging (RIS-PACS), digital pathology, clinical genomics, pharmacogenomics, and biosensor data in a pay-as-you-go model that eliminates the need for HDOs to procure and maintain costly infrastructure, enabling Precision Medicine, something that the White House described in 2015 as “one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs that we have ever seen”<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

According to analyst firm Gartner, by 2021 approximately 25% of HDOs with more than $1 billion in revenue will provide real-time, genomics-based clinical decision at the time of prescription<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>. Yet, according to HIMSS Analytics, the most significant challenge in Precision Medicine is clinical data systems and clinical genomic data integration<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>. That is why Kanteron Systems has now partnered with Google Cloud Platform to deliver leading Healthcare IT solutions.

“The combination of Kanteron Systems’ pioneering technology and Google Cloud Platform frees hospital IT teams from the overhead of managing growing infrastructure or manually integrating patient data and test results,” said Jorge Cortell, Founder & CEO of Kanteron Systems. “Kanteron Systems on Google Cloud Platform allows clinicians to focus on delivering the best care with our unique built-in security, advanced care coordination and collaboration, ease, and speed.”

“We are particularly excited about the tremendous potential of Kanteron Systems’ clinical and imaging data handling capabilities, combined with Google’s Artificial Intelligence and Cloud offerings,” said John Memarian, Kanteron Systems President and Chief Commercial Officer “which will allow the accelerated development of new healthcare applications on top of it”.

Designed to interoperate with existing clinical enterprise systems (PACS, RIS, EMR, LIMS, etc), Kanteron Systems solution automates the provisioning and management of a complete Precision Medicine Platform that guarantees high availability in multiple clouds, all while reducing license footprint and related infrastructure costs.
