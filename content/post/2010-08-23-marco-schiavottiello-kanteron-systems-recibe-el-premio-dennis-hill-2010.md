"The Dennis Hill Award recognises outstanding work in the field of healthcare technologies.  It is awarded annually to a student on a taught MSc programme.

The prize is awarded annually to the student on a taught MSc programme who has, during the past year, submitted the best MSc project dissertation in the general field of healthcare technologies and cognate subjects (including biomedical engineering and health informatics).
