IBM Beacon Awards recognize IBM Business Partners for their technical excellence, industry expertise, and innovative solutions.

Kanteron Systems was named a winner of a 2013 IBM Beacon Award for Healthcare and Life Sciences. This honor is awarded each year in recognition of a select number of IBM Business Partners who have delivered not only innovative solutions but have set the standards for business excellence, ingenuity, and creation of an exceptional client experience. Kanteron Systems is the only company from Spain to win such award this year.

Kanteron Systems‘ medical imaging solutions are enabling telepathology and teleradiology in hospital networks worldwide, like the largest outsorced medical imaging system in Latin America, which we manage along with IBM Peru
