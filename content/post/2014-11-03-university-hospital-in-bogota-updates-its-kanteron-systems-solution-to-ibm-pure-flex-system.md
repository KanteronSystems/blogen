The University Hospital San Ignacio (HUSI) at the Javeriana University in Bogota (Colombia) has chosen to renew the Kanteron Systems digital medical imaging solution they have been using since 2011.

This updates the PACS and RIS system to the corresponding modules of the newKanteron Systems TMIS (Translational Medical Imaging System). The new system is being installed in an IBM Pure Flex platform providing HUSI with new features, improved performance and speed, flexibility and unparalleled convenience to provide access to users through a web interface (HTML5) without installing any software (zero-footprint) and accessible from any device (responsive design).

Kanteron Systems would like to thank HUSI for the trust they have shown in our solution and service.
