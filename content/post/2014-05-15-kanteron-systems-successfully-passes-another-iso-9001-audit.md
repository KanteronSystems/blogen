Since we first received our ISO 9001 quality certification in 2008, we have always passed audits. Since 2012, we have passed them with ZERO non-conformities. But in a clear sign of continuous improvement, this year the auditorâ€˜s report reads:

> The quality management system has been implemented and maintained quite successfully at Kanteron Systems, showing a positive evolution since last year.

He also recommends us to be included in the Excellence recognition. Congratulations to the Quality team!
