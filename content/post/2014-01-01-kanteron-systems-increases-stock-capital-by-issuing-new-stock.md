Kanteron Systems increased its stock share capital today by issuing nearly 30% new stock, bringing itâ€™s outstanding stock share capital to nearly half a million US dollars. This issued share capital has been subscribed by Jorge Cortell, founder and CEO of Kanteron Systems, who remains the sole proprietor of the company.

> This new issue of share capital is meant to provide further stability and strength so Kanteron Systems can undertake the ambitious expansion it has planned for 2014

declared Jorge Cortell.
