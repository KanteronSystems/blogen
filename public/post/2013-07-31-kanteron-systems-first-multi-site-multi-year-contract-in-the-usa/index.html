<p>&ldquo;At Kanteron Systems we are very happy to have the opportunity to work with the experienced team at Monticello Diagnostic Imaging. They have made it their priority to offer their referring physicians and patients easy access to the best medical imaging and reports, and we are proud to have been chosen, after testing several other systems available in the market, to help them accomplish that goal&rdquo;, said Jorge Cortell, CEO of Kanteron Systems. One year after establishing Kanteron Systems‘ USA subsidiary, &ldquo;this is going to be the first of a long list of customers in the USA. As a matter of fact we are already negotiating contracts with several large and well known hospital networks&rdquo; Jorge Cortell commented.</p>
<p>The implementation of KMIIS enables Monticello Diagnostic Imaging to consolidate digital data, speed up their workflow, and ease referring physicians access to their images and reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needed a vendor neutral PACS that could integrate both with our Mac based workstations and with vendor specific hospital based systems, and then deliver multimedia digital reports to physicians‘ multi-platform portable devices and workstations. We were attracted to Kanteron‘s rapid development cycle; and an approach which simplifies patient data handling. Rather than selecting an off-the-shelf system, Kanteron‘s solution was to tailor the system to our needs, resulting in a unique product that can deliver precisely what the physicians want,&rdquo; stated Dr. Paul Marsh, one of the Monticello Radiologists. </p>
<p>Kanteron’s KMIIS, a cutting-edge medical workflow management system, enhances management of radiology and pathology information and images within hospital networks. While fully interoperable with PACS-Vendor Neutral Archive, EHR, RIS, and LIS via standards (like DICOM and HL7), KMIIS also includes an HTML5 zero-footprint remote single interface for access to PACS, VNA, RIS, WorkList Server, and Digital Pathology image viewer. </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With three locations in Texas (Forth Worth, Burleson, and Decatur), and connected to Wise Regional Hospital, Monticello Diagnostic Imaging currently has two Open MRI, two High Field MRI, two CT, and two CR modalities, supplied by Philips, General Electric, Siemens, and Hitachi. Kanteron Systems installed the system, integrated all modalities, and migrated all previous data in a single weekend, so Monticello Diagnostic Imaging did not have to pause their operations at all. </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Kanteron Systems is a leading open-source software company founded in 2005, specializing in medical imaging. Our award-winning technology enables full-resolution real-time teleradiology and telepathology (an industry first) in standard DICOM image format, as well as imaging storage and workflow, and healthcare data integration. With offices in New York (USA), Lima (Peru), and Valencia (Spain), Kanteron Systems provides advanced medical imaging software solutions to some of the largest healthcare networks in the world (like the NHS in the UK, ISSSTE in Mexico, and EsSalud in Peru). </p>
