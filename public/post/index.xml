      <description>Despite adverse economic conditions in Europe, Kanteron Systems invested over half a million euros in R&amp;amp;D in 2012.
We believe private and public research investment is absolutely necessary, and we ask the Spanish Government to keep funding research projects and research institutions, like CSIC(national research center, which needs 75 million euros to survive), and not waste our tax money in unnecesary megalomaniac projects like Madrid 2020 olympic (2,418.75 million euros budget, over 30 million already wasted in bid), or corruptionscandals.</description>

      <description>According to a Kauffman study:
 Among Emerging Growth Companies firms that made IPOs from 1996 through 2000, only 29 percent were still operating 10 years later. However, acquisition was a far more common outcome than was failure (55 percent vs. 16 percent). Biomedical IPOs had the highest survival and lowest bankruptcy rates among all sectors; the highest failure rates were in manufacturing and retail.

      <description>From a ReadWriteWeb article:
 Dr. J. Deane Waldman, Professor of Pediatrics, Pathology &amp;amp; Decision Science at the University of New Mexico said the industry has three disincentives to innovation that will partly suppress the effect of Moore‘s law, including:
 Regulatory oversight that is completely focussed on compliance. &amp;ldquo;It discourages risk-taking and innovation,&amp;rdquo; Deane said. Health care doesn‘t have the same financial reward system. Facebook isn‘t about to pay $1 billion for the latest hot-ticket item in imaging and informatics.</description>

      <description>As the graph of audited end-of-year financial performance clearly shows, Kanteron Systems continues a strong growth year after year, having dedicated 25% of profits to R&amp;amp;D in 2010.
We would like to thank all our customers, distributors, employees, suppliers and collaborators, (we consider all of you friends) all of whom make this strong and continuous growth possible even in the most adverse and competitive market conditions ever.
Thank you!!!</description>

      <description>It is a pleasure to announce the winner of Kanteron‘s Distributor of the Year Award (Lima, Peru) and Reseller of the Year Award (IBM Peru).  It has been a close call, since competition was strong, but our Peru distributor and IBM deserve it since they have managed one very complex and successful project that joined Kanteron Systems, our Peru distributor and IBM in the most ambitious large-scale outsourced distributed medical imaging PACS in South America.</description>
