      <description>From a ReadWriteWeb article:
 Dr. J. Deane Waldman, Professor of Pediatrics, Pathology &amp;amp; Decision Science at the University of New Mexico said the industry has three disincentives to innovation that will partly suppress the effect of Moore‘s law, including:
 Regulatory oversight that is completely focussed on compliance. &amp;ldquo;It discourages risk-taking and innovation,&amp;rdquo; Deane said. Health care doesn‘t have the same financial reward system. Facebook isn‘t about to pay $1 billion for the latest hot-ticket item in imaging and informatics.</description>

      <description>According to this articlein the American Journal of Roentgenography:
 Complex breast imaging reports generated with ASR were associated with higher error rates than reports generated with conventional dictation transcription. The native language and the academic rank of the speaker did not have a strong influence on error rate.

      <description>To make a long story short: We‘ve had a blog for a while. Then we moved the office, then the servers and the hosting. In all those changes, we left the blog behind. Now we regain the blog. Hello world&amp;hellip;again. By the way, we will be writing in English and Spanish, here and there, about this and that. </description>
