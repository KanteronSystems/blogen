Portuguese Hospital Distrital da Horta EPE, located in the Azores Islands and founded in 1834, has chosen a Kanteron Systems PACS and diagnostic workstation solution to replace their previous Siemens PACS.

VBData and Kanteron Systems, as IBM partners, through its Portuguese subsidiary Softinsa, were awarded the contract on August 14. The installation hasÂ already started, after the solution has been completely translated into Portuguese.
