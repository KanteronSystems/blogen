Effective August 1st, Kanteron Systems has moved its headquarters to a new, larger building in Puçol (Valencia &#8211; Spain).

In its new location, Kanteron’s employees will enjoy a series of unique benefits, such as outdoor swimming pools (in the summer), tennis and basketball courts, soccer field, restaurant, easy parking, and several terraces with great views of the Mediterranean sea.

The modern 3 story building will easily allow Kanteron’s team to grow fivefold, which is our short-midterm growth estimate.

Located in a privately guarded residential area, next to the by-pass highway, a mere 15 minutes from the airport, and 20 minutes to Valencia’s downtown, Kanteron Systems’ new headquarters location and facilities will positively impact the quality of life of Kanteron Systems’ team.
