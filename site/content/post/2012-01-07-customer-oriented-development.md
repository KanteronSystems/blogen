At Kanteron Systems we pride ourselves in focusing our development efforts in what our customers need, what our customers like, what our customers could have... and to do it fast!

Examples range from the one-week development and testing time of the **"Review previous studies from the same patient" one-button new functionality in KDS**, to the "custom color look-up tables to offset deficiencies and particularities in a specific modality", or the DICOM Structured Report web tool.

And we want to thank the people that makes that possible (besides our awesome developers): YOU!, our customers and friends, who gives us ideas for functionalities, plug-ins... so go ahead and keep the conversation going strong.
