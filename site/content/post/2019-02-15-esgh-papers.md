Kanteron Systems Bioinformatics department, in collaboration with scientists from several institutions (like the University of Cambridge, Genomics England, Zetta, INCLIVA, CIPF, I2SysBio, CSIC, and CIBERDEM) will present 3 papers at the European Society of Human Genetics ([ESHG19](https://2019.eshg.org/)) annual meeting to be held in Gothenburg, Sweden, June 15–18, 2019.

Led by Dr. Pablo Marin, along other members of his team like bioinformatician David Gómez-Peregrina and mathmatician Dr. Josemi Juanes, the 3 scientific papers to be presented at ESHG19 will be:

* Oskar: a Spark-based framework for big data variant analysis
* PanelMaps: a genome-scale coverage QC and CNV advisor web application

In Kanteron Systems we're proud of the research and development work our Bioinformatics department is producing, in collaboration with otherinstitutions, and in an open-science manner. This research is later converted, with the help of our Software Development department, into Precision Medicine solutions available to clinicians worldwide.

Great job, team!
