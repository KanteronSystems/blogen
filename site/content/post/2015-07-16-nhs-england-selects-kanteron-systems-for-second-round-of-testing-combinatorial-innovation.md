Together with the Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs), and HM Government, NHS England has invited Kanteron Systems to the second round of their ‘test bed programme.

The test bed programme is about deploying technologies that are ready to use, in NHS settings—not about inventing new ones.

Kanteron Systems is ready to accept this challenge and deliver what the NHS has described as ‘high value innovation‘.

July 29th, at The Kia Oval, London, Kanteron Systems will meet several NHS sites interested in deploying our solutions.
