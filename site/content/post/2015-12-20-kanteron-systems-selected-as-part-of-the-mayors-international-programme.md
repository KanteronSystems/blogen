Kanteron Systems has been selected as one of the 35 companies forming the initial cohort of the <a href="http://gotogrow.london/" target="_blank">Mayor’s International Programme</a>.

The programme will support high growth businesses from London’s Technology, Life Sciences and Urban sectors to expand their businesses internationally. It is run by London & Partners (supported by the Mayor), partly funded by the European Development Fund and partly by five private sector delivery partners: BDO, Benoy, KPMG, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry & PA Consulting. As members, Kanteron Systems will participate in mentoring, business opportunities, workshops and overseas missions.
