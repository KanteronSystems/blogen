Healthcare information systems leader Kanteron Systems, in collaboration with the NHS National Health System (NHS) England’s Open Source and Code 4 Health Programmes, has agreed to allow the entire NHS unrestricted access to Kanteron’s medical imaging and genomic data integration platform under the custodianship of an NHS clinically led OpenPACS Code 4 Health community. The agreement was announced at RSNA – the world’s largest gathering of clinical medical imaging professionals – in Chicago (USA).

Independent research suggests that provision of the Kanteron platform may result in significant benefits to the NHS, both in terms of providing millions of pounds in financial savings yearly, and improving patient outcomes through improvements in the diagnosis of a large number of conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and many more.

Kanteron Systems‘ healthcare IT solution, the Translational Medical Information Server (TMIS), is the first truly complete personalized medicine solution in the market. It’s a platform that integrates genomics, pharmacogenomics, digital pathology, radiology, biosensors, and analytics into a single unified workflow to produce a complete visualization with deep integration, enabling researchers and clinicians to reach precise diagnostics with unparalleled ease and speed.

The agreement will not only allow NHS Trusts to access imaging and genomic data at the point of care, but it will also allow the NHS and higher education institutions in the UK to leverage Kanteron’s platform to develop new software components (“plug-ins”), through a single code repository, to enhance functionality. The NHS OpenPACS community, in conjunction with Kanteron Systems, will then be responsible for repository access, quality control, CE medical device certification and ISO certified quality management for the updated versions.

Kanteron, alongside selected technology partners IBM, Microsoft and Hitachi Data Systems, will offer additional services like consulting, implementation, integration, migration, tech support, etc. to support the adoption of new clinical workflows.

“Integrating medical imaging, digital pathology, clinical genomic, pharmacogenomic, and biosensor data into Electronic Patient Record systems to apply personalized medicine to a large-scale patient base is something that has never been done before, and the benefits to patients and hospitals are now obtainable” said Jorge Cortell, CEO, Kanteron Systems. "We are proud to lead this exciting and innovative initiative, partnering with the NHS.”
