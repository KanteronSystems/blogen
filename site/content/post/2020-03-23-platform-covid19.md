Kanteron Systems Platform for healthcare data integration has been reviewed by World Health Organization experts (former consultants) for its applicability to COVID-19.

<!--more-->

After [offering our technology to the EU on March 11th](https://blog.kanteron.com/2020/03/doing-our-part-to-fight-covid-19/), Kanteron Systems reached out to two WHO experts to assess the applicability of our technology to the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Kanteron Systems has adapted its platform, which integrates medical imaging (PACS-RIS), digital pathology (WSI), clinical genomics (PCR and NGS data analysis workflows). It also creates automatic technical reports for precision medicine with fully integrated QC and LIMS procedures. All this patient-centric data can be easily integrated in HIS/EMR systems and use HL7 standard protocols.

Applications:

- Increased prevention: It allows some healthcare workers to work remotely (teleradiology, telepathology, and telegenomics), preventing contagions and unnecessary reduction of needed healthcare personnel.
- Faster and more accurate diagnosis: It gives healthcare institutions the needed flexibility to use one or many diagnosis methods (PCR, Ultrasound, XRays, CT Scans, Pathology...), and integrate the results with the patient's medical record.
- Scale: With asynchronous and remote interconnected systems, care (from diagnosis to treatment and follow up) can be provided remotely, thus maximizing both geographical coverage and availability of scarce resources.
- Real-time population health and epidemiology reporting: Once this data is integrated both at a workflow level and at a patient level, it can then form part of larger population health and epidemiologic alert systems for an efficient processing of infectious disease events.
- Genomics and pharmacogenomics (in development): as more is known about the virus, how it affects different patients according to their DNA, and how they react to prescribed medications, it is possible to analyze what risk factor and response to treatment each person may have.

Here's what those experts had to say about Kanteron's Platform as applied to the COVID-19 pandemic:

> **Spectacular!**

Dr. Jordi Serrano-Pons, Geneva (Switzerland): Innovation Adviser at World Health Organization; Founder of UniversalDoctor.

> I think the platform could be of **great benefit** by pooling expertise from various specialisms in a single platform enabling discussions of: A) Epidemiology and clinical experts (read also virologist and hospital laboratory specialists) for public health - epidemiological - outbreak control purposes, particularly for rapid communication for geographically dispersed teams(...) ; and B) Various clinical experts within multidisciplinary care teams of the same hospital and on consultations regarding clinical cases between professionals of different hospitals. For example, a regional hospital consulting to a tertiary referral hospital on cases of ICU patients, particularly now that so many healthcare workers are falling sick and the currently perceived scarcity of ICU beds."

Francisco Cervero (Singapore): Global Health Consultant at World Health Organization; Health Systems, Policy & Economics Researcher at National University of Singapore.

Kanteron's Platform is already installed in some of the largest healthcare systems in the world, and we've started to receive reports that it is making a real difference. For further inquiries please [contact us using the form at the bottom of our web home page](https://www.kanteron.com/#CONTACT).

It has also been featured in Catalyst Health 2.0 [Health Tech Responds to COVID-19 website](https://www.covid19healthtech.com/companies/kanteron-systems).

Thank you for the relentless hard work, Kanteron team! ðŸ’ª
