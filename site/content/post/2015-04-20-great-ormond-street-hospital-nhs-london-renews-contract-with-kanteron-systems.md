Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) for Children, a National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in London, UK, has just renewed their services contract for a Cardiology PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) with Kanteron Systems.

The NHS has some of the most strict and demanding service contracts in the world. We are proud and honored that such an iconic institution in pediatric care as GOSH has been trusting Kanteron Systems for four years already.
