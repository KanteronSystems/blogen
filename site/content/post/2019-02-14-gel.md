The Computational Biology Lab at the University of Cambridge, led by Nacho Medina, joined forces with Kanteron Systems Bioinformatics department, led by Dr. Pablo Marin, seeking Kanteron's deep insight in clinical genomics, to  improve the powerful toolset created at Nacho´s lab. The software, result of that collaboration, is now the oficial pipeline for clinical genomic analysis at Genomics England and several other international projects, such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).

The [ICGC](https://icgc.org/), established in 2007, aimed to define the genomes of 25,000 primary untreated cancers (the 25K Initiative). The ICGC solved numerous data governance, ethical and logistical challenges to make global genomic data sharing for cancer possible, providing the international community with comprehensive genomic data for many cancer types.

> "No cancer therapy is developed today without the genomic knowledge that ICGC provided to the world."

[Genomics England (GeL)](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/) was set up to deliver the 100,000 Genomes Project, funded by the UK's National Institute for Health Research, NHS England, The Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council. The UK Government  announced £250 million for the introduction of whole genome sequencing in the NHS. In October 2018, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the expansion of the 100,000 Genomes Project to see 1 million whole genomes sequenced by the NHS and UK Biobank in five years and an ambitious vision for genomic medicine in the NHS – with plans to sequence 5 million genomes over the next five years.

Kanteron Systems is proud, humbled, and thankful to participate in the largest clinical genomics initiatives, through the collaboration with some of the world's top leading experts in genomics and bioinformatics, like Nacho Medina.
