Kanteron Systems Bioinformatics department, in collaboration with the Computational Biology Lab at the University of Cambridge and Zetta Genomics, deliver advanced clinical solution chosen by some of the largest clinical genomics projects, like Genomics England, the International Cancer Genome Consortium, or the The European Bioinformatics Institute.

The Computational Biology Lab at the University of Cambridge, led by Nacho Medina, joined forces with Zetta Genomics and Kanteron Systems Bioinformatics department, led by Dr. Pablo Marin and other members of his team (like bioinformatician David Gómez and mathmatician Dr. Josemi Juanes), working together in Cambridge, seeking Kanteron's deep insight in clinical genomics, to improve the powerful [toolset](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/compbio/OpenCB) created at Nacho´s lab.

Dr. Marín's team works on the creation of innovative solutions focused on the CDSS (*Clinical Decision Support System*) that make Personalized Medicine a reality at scale, facilitating the work of the geneticist in the creation of more precise, detailed, complete and fast clinical and diagnostic reports.

The software, result of that collaboration, is the most advanced and useful platform available for Precision Medicine today, and has become the oficial pipeline for clinical genomic analysis at Genomics England and several other international projects, such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), or the The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

The [ICGC](https://icgc.org/), established in 2007, aimed to define the genomes of 25,000 primary untreated cancers (the 25K Initiative). The ICGC solved numerous data governance, ethical and logistical challenges to make global genomic data sharing for cancer possible, providing the international community with comprehensive genomic data for many cancer types.

> "No cancer therapy is developed today without the genomic knowledge that ICGC provided to the world."

The [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) is an International Government Organization which as part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) family focuses on research and services in bioinformatics. As part of EMBL, the largest part of EMBL-EBI's funding comes from the governments of EMBL's 21 member states. Other major funders include the European Commission, Wellcome Trust, US National Institutes of Health, and UK Government. The EMBL-EBI receives 38 million average daily data request from 3.3 million unique IP addresses, which last year downloaded 8,7 Petabytes of data.

[Genomics England (GeL)](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/) was set up to deliver the 100,000 Genomes Project, funded by the UK's National Institute for Health Research, NHS England, The Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council. The UK Government  announced £250 million for the introduction of whole genome sequencing in the NHS. In October 2018, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the expansion of the 100,000 Genomes Project to see 1 million whole genomes sequenced by the NHS and UK Biobank in five years and an ambitious vision for genomic medicine in the NHS – with plans to sequence 5 million genomes over the next five years.

Kanteron Systems is proud, humbled, and thankful to participate in the largest clinical genomics initiatives, through the collaboration with some of the world's top leading experts in genomics and bioinformatics, like Nacho Medina.
