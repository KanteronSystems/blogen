Dr Raminderpal Singh has joined Kanteron Systems as Strategic Advisor.
  
Dr. Singh was until now Business Development & Strategy Lead at IBM Research-Genomic Medicine. His experience in Venture Capital at 3i Group, as well as his international experience with healthcare organizations in countries like Singapore, UK, and Canada, and with deals and partnerships in USA, China, India, Russia, and Brazil fit perfectly well with Kanteron’s momentum of explosive international growth and exploration of new partnerships and corporate options.

Santiago Gala joins Kanteron as Platform Architect.
  
Vicepresident and Chairman of the Apache Foundation Portals project, Santiago was leader of several Artificial Intelligent projects for European Space Agency, and has been Indra’s R&D Manager for almost a decade. He has demonstrated his knowledge and capability in projects such as the design and implementation of Telefonica’s intranet.
  
Santiago will be temporarily based in Dubai to oversee the implementation of Kanteron System’s projects in the region, while we build our local team in the UAE.

We are proud and excited to have such high level and experienced scientist join Kanteron Systems.
