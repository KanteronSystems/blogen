On February 10th, the Peruvian government awarded through public bid contract LP 013-2014-MINSA the supply of technology behind three Deployable Mobile Hospitals to Kanteron Systems.

The three Deployable Mobile Hospitals will be delivered by a consortium of companies.

> We are proud that Kanteron Systems‘ technology has been selected for this large project, which will enable the Peruvian Government to better serve its citizens through mobile hospitals deployable in remote regions, in cases of natural disasters, or in conflict zones.
