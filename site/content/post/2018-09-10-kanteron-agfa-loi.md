Kanteron Systems confirms it has sent the Board of Directors of [Agfa-Gevaert NV](http://www.agfa.com/corporate/) a non-binding indication of interest for the acquisition of all shares in Agfa-Gevaert NV by way of a voluntary conditional public takeover offer of Kanteron Systems to all shareholders of Agfa-Gevaert NV.

 > "Agfa Healthcare business unit revenues have been stagnant in the last few years. However, a deal with Kanteron would allow Agfa to tap into our leading-edge technology, particularly in Pathology and Genomics, enabling Agfa to take the lead in the new Clinical Information Systems for Precision Medicine market, which is a huge and disruptive long-term growth opportunity” commented Jorge Cortell, Kanteron Systems’ CEO. “Some of Agfa’s largest international distributors have already signed up with Kanteron Systems. It’s time we give the whole Agfa family access to our innovative technology”.

The communications between the companies are at an early stage, therefore, there is no certainty as to whether, and under which conditions, Kanteron Systems may make a public tender offer to the shareholders of Agfa-Gevaert NV.
