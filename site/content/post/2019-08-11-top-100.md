According to the metrics and methodology of [the Financial Times 1000: Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies](httpss://www.ft.com/content/238174d2-3139-11e9-8744-e7016697f225) **Kanteron Systems currently meets the criteria to be in the top 100 of Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies**.

The FT 1000: Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies is a list of the top 1000 companies in Europe that have achieved the highest percentage growth in revenues in the last 3 years (the last edition covers 2015-2018).

> Estimated criteria for inclusion in the next list
>
> To be included in the list of Europe’s fastest growing companies, a company has to meet the following criteria:
>
    - Revenue of at least €100,000 generated in 2016 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).
    - Revenue of at least €1.5 million generated in 2019 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).
    - The company is independent (the company is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind).
    - The revenue growth between 2016 and 2019 was primarily organic (ie “internally” stimulated)
    - If a company is listed on a stock exchange, its share price has not fallen 50% or more since 2019

>
The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated as follows:
((revenue2019 / revenue2016)^(1/3)) - 1 = CAGR
>
The absolute growth between 2014 and 2017 was calculated as follows:
(revenue2019 / revenue2016) - 1 = Growth rate

After accounting revisions and external audits, Kanteron Systems estimates that it has experienced a YtD (Year to Date) 2016-2019 CAGR (Compound annual growth rate) of 1316% and an Absolute Growth of 11422%, which (even considering historical inter-annual variations) would place it in the list of **Europe’s top 100 Fastest Growing Companies**, making it one of only 9 Spanish companies in the list, and **the fastest growing Spanish Technology company** today.
