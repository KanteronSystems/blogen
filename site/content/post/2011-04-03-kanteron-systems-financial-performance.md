As the graph of audited end-of-year financial performance clearly shows, Kanteron Systems continues a strong growth year after year, having dedicated 25% of profits to R&D in 2010.

We would like to thank all our customers, distributors, employees, suppliers and collaborators, (we consider all of you friends) all of whom make this strong and continuous growth possible even in the most adverse and competitive market conditions ever.

Thank you!!!
