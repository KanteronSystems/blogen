Many hospitals are considering vendor-neutral solutions for archiving and accessing medical images to avoid being locked into closed, proprietary software, according the report "In Enterprise Imaging: A Vendor Reality Check"Â from market research firm KLAS.The study found that while many providers are looking to their PACS vendor as a likely enterprise imaging partner, they also recognize the potential pitfalls of getting locked into a proprietary solution that may not translate well from one department to another."A number of hospitals are beginning to take ownership of their medical images by building PACS-neutral archives and storage management layers," Brown said. "This approach allows the PACS to simply become a physician-friendly viewing and interaction layer that can be upgraded or replaced without the typically painful migration."Kanteron Systems offer one of the most robust, interoperable, and high-performance vendor-neutral PACS in the market.
