Many hospitals are considering vendor-neutral solutions for archiving and accessing medical images to avoid being locked into closed, proprietary software, according the report &#8220;In Enterprise Imaging: A Vendor Reality Check&#8221;Â from market research firm KLAS.The study found that while many providers are looking to their PACS vendor as a likely enterprise imaging partner, they also recognize the potential pitfalls of getting locked into a proprietary solution that may not translate well from one department to another.&#8221;A number of hospitals are beginning to take ownership of their medical images by building PACS-neutral archives and storage management layers,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;This approach allows the PACS to simply become a physician-friendly viewing and interaction layer that can be upgraded or replaced without the typically painful migration.&#8221;Kanteron Systems offer one of the most robust, interoperable, and high-performance vendor-neutral PACS in the market.
