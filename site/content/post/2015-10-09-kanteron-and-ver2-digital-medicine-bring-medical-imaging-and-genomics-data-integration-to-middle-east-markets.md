Kanteron Systems and Ver2 Digital Medicine introduce the first Medical Imaging and Genomics Data Integration platform in the United Arab Emirates.

Doctors in the Middle East can now examine your symptoms, correlate them with your electronic medical records, medical imaging exams, pathology tests, and your genomic data. Doctors then instantly compare those results with the data on thousands of other individuals to deliver a detailed diagnosis — or even detect an illness before the symptoms appear. Kanteron Systems, a global leader in Healthcare IT and Biomedical Informatics, is bringing those capabilities to healthcare providers in the United Arab Emirates through a partnership with Ver2 Digital Medicine.

Kanteron Systems integrates pharmacogenomics, digital pathology, radiology, biosensors, analytics, and genomics into a single unified workflow. Recently, the company announced the release of its Translational Medical Information System, making the full integration and visualization of a unified system a reality. There is currently no other company that combines all those capabilities in one platform.

> “For the first time, comprehensive, integrated, and meaningful genomic and medical imaging data integration is within the reach of healthcare institutions in the Middle East, which not only will speed up the time to diagnose, but will enable the discovery of new biomarkers and pharmaceutical targets, changing the discovery of biological pathways forever and bringing new meaning to the term ‘personalized medicine’. We are glad to be able to have a partner in the region with as much knowledge, vision, and experience as Ver2.” Kanteron founder and CEO Jorge Cortell explains.

> “We are creating the future of medicine today, in the Middle East and Africa supported by visionary innovators such as Kanteron Systems. We are not constrained by gridlocked and antiquated legacy healthcare systems. We are essentially working with a blank canvas on which we are creating better medicine.” said Brian de Francesca, CEO of Ver2.
