Timely communications are essential in any organization. Even more when the team is distributed. Kanteron Systems operates in 15 countries, with a team spread throughout 6 countries, and 8 cities. For that reason, and to make sure that our investors can access the latest information about Kanteron in a timely manner, we're launching the [Kanteron Investors app](https://investors.kanteron.com/), available from any mobile device (obviously, the app requires user authentication and a password).

Some of the features included are:

* Regular board updates
* Company profile
* Latest published figures with real-time graphs and KPIs
* Management directory with contact info
* Direct in-app chat
