Kanteron Systems is proud to announce the release of the CloudApp plug-in for Osirix and is making it available to the whole Osirix community for free.

The ever-growing involvement of Kanteron Systems with Free and Open Source healthcare projects like Osirix goes beyond being the largest ("Diamond") Sponsors and involves coding, developing, from bug-detection and solution, to code improvement (such as increased AppleScript interoperability) to contributions both inside Osirix and externally such as this plug-in.

With the CloudApp plug-in Osirix users will be able to upload their studies and DICOM images to the CloudApp webservice, from which studies and images can be securely shared and stored in the cloud for free.
