The Spanish medical data software firm attributed the growth to an increase in its Platform sales during the last months of 2016.

By geographies, the North American market experienced the biggest YoY growth. The firm also secured new contracts that expand its worldwide installed base to include 3 new countries (Chile, Ethiopia, and UAE).

The company also said that the US Food and Drug Administration communicated to Kanteron Systems that it does not require a regulatory filing of Kanteron’s Platform anymore, in accordance to the new 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act – Public Law No. 114-255) Section 3060/C/D/E, “due to the low risk they pose to patients and the importance they play in advancing digital health”.

>We are very pleased with our results in 2016, 

Kanteron Systems Founder & CEO Jorge Cortell said in a statement. 

>Furthermore, with our strong 2017 start along with a tremendous commercial and innovation pipeline, we are convinced this year is going to be even better.
