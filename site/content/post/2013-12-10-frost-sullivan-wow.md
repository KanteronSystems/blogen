Global growth consulting firm <a title="http://www.frost.com/" href="http://www.frost.com/" target="_blank">Frost & Sullivan</a>, which provides market research and analysis for the Healthcare Industry (amongst others), published today the report “_RSNA 2013 Review: Scouting the Showfloor for the Latest-Greatest in Medical Imaging and Imaging Informatics_”. In the report’s “_Select WOW! Findings from the Showfloor_” section, Nadim Michel Daher, Principal Analyst – Medical Imaging and Imaging Informatics, and Siddharth Saha, Global Program Leader Advanced MedTech, identify six companies with disruptive innovations in Medical Imaging and Imaging Informatics. One of them is Kanteron Systems. Here is what the report says:

> Kanteron Systems: Integrated IT Platform for Imaging, Digital Pathology and Genomics
> 
> An IBM business partner, Kanteron Systems demoed the major steps it has taken in unifying the archival of three ‘big’ patient data elements: 1- Medical imaging, 2-pathology images and 3-genetic information within a single platform. While digital pathology is slowly starting to make its way as part of a broader enterprise IT strategy, Genomics will likely be the next frontier.

Kanteron Systems is proud to receive this recognition from one of the most highly regarded independent analyst firms in the industry, which joins the many other validation and recognition reports and feedbacks we have received since [the introduction of Kanteron’s Translational Medical Imaging System (TMIS) at RSNA 2013, last week](http://www.kanteron.com/blog/healthcare/2013/11/kanteron-systems-introduces-the-first-translational-pacs-in-the-world-at-rsna-2013/ "Kanteron Systems introduces the first Translational PACS in the world at RSNA 2013").
