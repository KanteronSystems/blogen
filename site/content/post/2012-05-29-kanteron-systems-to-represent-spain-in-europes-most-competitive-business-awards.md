The European Business Awards has identified some of Europe’s brightest businesses based on their ability to demonstrate the three core principles at the heart of the Awards program. The <a title="http://www.businessawardseurope.com/judges" href="http://www.businessawardseurope.com/judges" target="_blank">panel of judges</a> were looking for organizations to represent Spain who exhibited **innovation, business excellence and sustainability**.

> At Kanteron Systems we’re thrilled to be selected to represent Spain. We’ve been operating for over 6 years in the Open Source Healthcare IT sector and it’s an honor to be recognized as one of the leading organizations in our country and in our field.

The European Business Awards recognizes companies who excel in delivering innovation twinned with successful commercial results whilst acting responsibly and positively affecting the social environment they operate in. The 2011 European Business Awards showcased organizations with a combined turnover of €1 trillion Euros (8.23% of EU GDP including Turkey, Armenia, Georgia and Kazakhstan). These businesses employ over 2.7 million people across the continent.

Adrian Tripp, CEO of the European Business Awards says:

> Over the past six years we’ve received an incredibly high standard of entries from organizations that are passionate about their business. However, very few get the chance to fly the flag for their country and compete across Europe to be recognized as one of Europe’s leading companies. It really is an exceptional accolade to be picked as a National Finalist.
