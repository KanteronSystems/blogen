Kanteron Systems has been selected, pre-screened and chosen from over 250 companies by the selection committee, to present in <a title="https://www.techtour.com/events/view.aspx?events_pages_id=2823" href="https://www.techtour.com/events/view.aspx?events_pages_id=2823" target="_blank">Iberian Tech Tour</a>, October 1-3, 2014, which will cover 25 companies from Portugal and Spain.

Why "Iberian"? The City of Lisbon and the Region of Valencia in late June were named European Entrepreneurial Region (EER) for 2015. The EER project identifies and rewards EU regions that show a remarkable and innovative entrepreneurial strategy regardless of their size or economic situation. It is aimed at showcasing the regions with the most forward-thinking vision and plan.
