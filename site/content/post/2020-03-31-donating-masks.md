Kanteron Systems donated today a bath of N95 respirators and surgical masks to help local health authorities fight the CoViD-19 pandemic.

The [Civil Protection team in Pu√ßol](https://www.facebook.com/ProteccioCivilPucol) (Spain), one of the unsung heroes fighting to protect all of us in this pandemic, like healthcare workers, police, delivery personnel, supermarket workers... will pick up the N95 respirators and surgical masks to deliver them to Valencia University Hospital.

We must all contribute. United for the common good.
