<p class="p1">
  Kanteron Systems today introduced a new way to connect medical imaging devices.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  “Kanteron’s DirectTransfer” will enable hospital networks achieve higher transfer speeds, reduce cost, and establish large-scale telemedicine networks seamlessly by applying new network protocols and computer algorithms.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  After leading the industry in digital pathology dicomization, and enhancing clinical genomics with imaging integration. Kanteron Systems has developed a new industry first, by leveraging the latest network protocols designed with online multimedia and applying lessons learned from the “Internet of Things” (IoT), to achieve more efficient routing and packet processing, directed data flows, simplified network configuration and enhanced security.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  “Existing medical imaging and data systems rely on networking mechanisms that are decades old,” said Jorge Cortell, CEO of Kanteron Systems. “By applying the latest technologies available and leveraging new computer code algorithms, our platform sets a new gold standard in healthcare data exchange and integration.” In technical terms, this new era of healthcare data connectivity means:
</p>

<li class="p1">
  Moving from broadcast to multicast (or unicast)
</li>
<li class="p1">
  From Network Address Translation (NAT) to true end-to-end connectivity with simplified network configuration (address auto-configuration)
</li>
<li class="p1">
  From indiscriminate transmissions to Quality of Service (QoS)
</li>

<p class="p1">
  What does this new code base mean for the user? For example when handling many images (like digital pathology) or complex data sets (like next generation genomic sequencing), as Kanteron’s DirectTransfer multiplexes the petitions to the server, the downloading of images and data sets happens in parallel, which means much faster speeds than any other method available in the market today, including streaming.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Beyond speed, reliability is another key for healthcare data exchange. Kanteron’s DirectTransfer enables connecting to more than one service provider at the same time. So if one service fails, communication sessions automatically move over to another.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Reliability is further enhanced thanks to autoconfiguration. Older systems rely on DHCP servers (or cumbersome manual configurations that consume precious IT department resources) to assign network addresses to devices, which can cause problems in larger institutions suppling conflicting information or changing addresses after reboots. With Kanteron’s DirectTransfer, all that is largely unnecessary because of stateless autoconfiguration. Which means seamless connectivity between a virtually unlimited number of medical devices.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  With Kanteron’s DirectTransfer, every medical device in a network can literally have its own unique address. Most healthcare institutions only have several IP addresses on the Internet, assigned to the router that connects them to their service provider. The router in turn issues IP addresses internally to the devices that attach to it, but must constantly keep track of which traffic belongs to which device, and translate the IP address from the internal one to the public one in order to facilitate communications with other healthcare institutions. Kanteron’s DirectTransfer does not need any of that, which means faster, easier, more reliable, secure and transparent data integration between healthcare institutions.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But perhaps the most important and radical innovation in Kanteron’s DirectTransfer is found in data security. Most existing connection mechanisms have not been designed with security in mind. Therefore healthcare systems usually rely on cumbersome and often vulnerable firewalls and SSL, which only works on part of the data transmission. Security is also harder to deploy and troubleshoot because existing systems use NATs, which disrupt traceability, and therefore security audit trails, considered by some security protocols to be a security violation.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Kanteron’s DirectTransfer’s Security also includes:
</p>

<li class="p1">
  Special security layer built-in, encrypting each individual packet, this can be applied to all data traffic
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Signature-based authentication algorithms aimed at making sure data traffic gets to the correct destination without being intercepted
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Enabling digital key exchanges, and virtual tunnels
</li>
<li class="p1">
  An additional algorithm provides confidentiality, authentication of the source
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Connectionless integrity of the inner packet
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Antireplay
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Limited traffic flow confidentiality
</li>

<p class="p1">
  To ensure compatibility with existing hospital networks, DirectTransfer is “backwards compatible” with previous networking structures. This ensures the connectivity between old and new networks is guaranteed through the built in “dual stack”.
