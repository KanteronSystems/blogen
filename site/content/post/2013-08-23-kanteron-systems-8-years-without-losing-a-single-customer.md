Today Kanteron Systems turns 8 years old.

We want to thank those that have made this possible, that believed in us, that helped us, that are part of our organization, and specially that have trusted us with their business.

We have as many reasons to be proud about as we have things to improve. But if there is one very telling fact looking back in all those years, it‘s this: we have not lost a <a title="Customers" href="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/reference-installations/" target="_blank">customer</a>. Not a single one. Apparently our solutions, integration, training, customization, technical support, and price can‘t be beaten.
