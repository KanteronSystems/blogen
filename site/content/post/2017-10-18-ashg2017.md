This event, defined by its organizers as "a forum for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge science in all areas of Human Genetics", is the largest gathering of Human Genetics in the world. In this 67th edition it brought together more than 7,000 specialists in the field, and more than 200 exhibiting companies. Among the best-known speakers were Bill Gates (leader of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) and Francis Collins (director of the US National Institute of Health).
