Kanteron Systems' new version of its KDS (Kanteron DICOM Station) advanced visualization and post-processing radiology workstation can now be installed in all major operating systems (Linux Debian, Windows 10, and Apple OSX).

KDS is a multi-platform medical imaging software for DICOM objects generated by medical equipment (MRI, CT, PET, PET-CT, CR, MG,...) fully compliant with the DICOM standard for image communication and image file formats. It can also read many other file formats specified by the MetaIO standard (.mhd files).

KDS is able to receive images transferred by DICOM communication protocol from any PACS or medical imaging modality (STORE SCP - Service Class Provider, STORE SCU - Service Class User, and Query/Retrieve). It enables navigation and visualization of multimodal and multidimensional images through a complete 2D Viewer which integrates advanced reconstruction techniques such as Thick Slab, including Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Minimum Intensity Projection (MinIP) and average projection, fast orthogonal reconstruction, 3D navigation tools such as 3D-Cursor, and support for PET-CT image fusion. It also incorporates Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) and 3D Viewer for volume rendering with pre-defined rendering settings. Of course, it can handle workflow functions like DICOMDIR CD burning, auto-routing, etc.
