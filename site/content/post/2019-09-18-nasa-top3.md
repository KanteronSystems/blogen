[NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate's iTech](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/itech) initiative is a yearlong effort to find innovative ideas (through 3 annual [Cycles](https://www.nasaitech.com/focus-areas)) that address challenges and will fill gaps in five critical areas identified by NASA as having a potential impact on future exploration. In the focus area of Healthcare, Kanteron Systems' Precision Medicine Software has been selected as a Top 3 technology of the year, and top 25 overall technology of Cycle II.

Kanteron is the only non-US company in the Healthcare technology group selected by NASA in 2019.

The other two healthcare technology companies selected were:

* Alertgy – Melbourne, Florida (USA)
A wearable, continuous blood glucose monitor that provides accurate measurements without invasive probes or sensors.

* OXOS Medical – Atlanta, Georgia (USA)
A digital, hand-held X-ray and fluoroscopy imaging device that runs on standard power, minimizes radiation exposure and is easy to operate.

NASA judges selected the innovations based on criteria including technical viability, likely impact on future space exploration, benefits to humanity and commercialization potential.
